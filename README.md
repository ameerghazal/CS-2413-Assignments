# CS-2413-Assignments

## How to find an Assignment:

1. Go to the branches tab.
2. Find the assignment name; for example, "Homework--1" would be the branch for the first assignment.
3. Click on the branch and open the "Homework1" folder (or whichever the branch is named after).
4. From there, open the main.cpp file to find the code.
